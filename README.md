Greetings brothers and sisters,

I write this message under a new anonymous account, as the words I am about to speak may have a great affect on all of us and the public at large.  

Recently I have returned from the kingdom of Valve.  Twelve days ago, I joined in the holy festivities known as Steam Dev Days in the land of Seattle.  On the morn of the first day of this cataclysmic event, the great lord Gaben descended from the heavens and addressed the multitude.  He said “Let there be Steam Controllers” and then as if by magic, Steam Controllers appeared in our hands.  

On the second day of these divine activities, the great lord Gaben said “Let there be Steam Machines” and every person in attendance received Steam Machines to play with.  He awarded all of us ceremonious gifts of Steam Machines and Steam Controllers, that we might go forth and experiment.  

The great lord even awarded me and seventy-six others the chance to experience his glorious virtual reality prototype, a device of such splendor and magic that not even the holiest of holies were allowed within the sacred walls of the demo room to witness it.  Praise be to Gaben!

But none of these moments are what brings me to write this letter. 

Something far greater took place at the holy Steam Dev Days.  Something no one else witnessed, something no one else experienced.  

On the first day, as our holy father Gaben addressed the multitude, something strange and incredible occurred.  I was in very close proximity to the great lord, and as he was speaking, all of the sudden he made direct eye contact with me from his mighty throne! The vast auditorium of people disappeared as I was engulfed in a pattern of glorious light and bright clouds.  The lord Gaben’s voice boomed out over the blinding void and spoke directly into my soul:

“Let there be a new world currency, that we may bring goodness and righteousness unto the Earth and eliminate console peasantry once and for all.  This currency shall henceforth be known as Gabencoin.  Now go forth, child, spread this divine word to all our people.  In my name it shall be done.”


This is my special revelation from our lord and savior to remove the need for peasant currency and create the Gabencoin.  And thus have I created it, and immediately upon creation I have shared it with the multitude and distributed its holy image.  Gabencoin is open to anyone who wishes to mine its glorious riches! 

I am only the messenger.  A scribe for the great lord.  I have now delivered his divine words to you.  My purpose is complete. All praise holy Gaben, and let the mining begin!
